# BlindAge

**Prove that you are old enough without proving who you are.**

Privacy-preserving age verification: a trusted issuer verifies a user's age
once and issues unlinkable, single-use anonymous age tokens. Websites learn
only whether the user satisfies a threshold (e.g. `AGE_OVER_18`) — never
identity. The issuer never learns where tokens are used.

> **Status: Phase 2 (Ed25519 tokens).** Tokens now carry real Ed25519
> signatures; the registry and issuer metadata publish only public keys.
> Issuance is still NOT blind — the issuer sees token values at signing, so
> the double-anonymity property (and the 1 expected XFAIL that tracks it)
> arrives with Phase 3 blind signatures (RFC 9474). Do not deploy yet.
>
> BlindAge provides privacy-preserving age *assurance*, not perfect age
> *enforcement* — it cannot fully prevent voluntary token sharing. The honest
> comparison is not "BlindAge vs perfect verification" but "BlindAge vs every
> website collecting government identity documents."

## Quick start

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/pytest                       # full suite; 1 XFAIL is expected (issuer sees token values until Phase 3)
./scripts/run_protocol_demo.sh         # end-to-end demo: enroll → mint → prove → redeem → replay-reject
```

## Troubleshooting

- **macOS: `import blindage` fails outside the repo root.** The editable-install
  `.pth` file in `.venv/lib/python*/site-packages/` can intermittently pick up
  the hidden (`UF_HIDDEN`) flag on this platform, and Python 3.13 skips hidden
  `.pth` files at startup, breaking the editable install for scripts run from
  other working directories. Fix with:

  ```bash
  chflags nohidden .venv/lib/python*/site-packages/*.pth
  ```
